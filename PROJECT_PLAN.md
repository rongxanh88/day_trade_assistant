# Day Trading Assistant - Project Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview
A LangGraph-powered trading assistant that identifies high-probability setups while keeping the human trader in complete control of execution decisions.

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### 1. **Core LangGraph Workflows**
- **Market Scanner**: Scan for potential setups on request from user
- **Setup Analyzer**: Deep dive analysis of flagged opportunities  
- **Risk Assessor**: Evaluate risk/reward ratios based on support and resistance levels
- **Alert Manager**: Notify trader of actionable setups

### 2. **Data Sources & APIs**
- **Tradier API**: Real-time quotes, options data, market hours
- **Technical Indicators**: Price Action, Volume, Support/Resistance
- **News Sentiment**: Market-moving news analysis
- **Economic Calendar**: Key events that impact volatility

### 3. **Setup Types to Identify**
- **Doji Sandwich**: Big Move prior day + Doji current day
- **Gap Plays**: Pre-market/post-market opportunities
- **Swing Trend Trades**: price action + trending with entire stock market direction + relative strength/weakness to overall market
- **Day Trades**: price action + relative strength/weakness to overall market + Long on stock above yesterday's high / Short a stock below yesterday's low

### Key LangGraph Features to Leverage
- **Checkpointing**: Persist state across market sessions
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Review setups before alerts
- **Conditional routing**: Different analysis paths for different setups
- **Error recovery**: Handle API failures gracefully
- **Parallel processing**: Analyze multiple symbols simultaneously
